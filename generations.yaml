    description: "The Volkswagen ID. Buzz represents a modern, all-electric reinterpretation of the iconic Type 2 Microbus (commonly known as the 'VW Bus' or 'Bulli'), combining retro-inspired design elements with Volkswagen's latest electric vehicle technology. Built on the dedicated MEB electric platform shared with other ID models, the ID. Buzz features distinctive two-tone paint options, short front and rear overhangs, large side windows, and an overall silhouette that clearly evokes its predecessor while incorporating contemporary design elements like LED lighting, aerodynamic wheels, and flush door handles. Initially launched in passenger (ID. Buzz) and cargo (ID. Buzz Cargo) variants, with standard and long-wheelbase configurations (the latter coming later to certain markets), the ID. Buzz offers unique versatility in the growing electric van segment. The first models feature a rear-mounted electric motor producing 201 horsepower (150 kW) and 229 lb-ft of torque driving the rear wheels—a layout that mirrors the original Type 2's rear-engine configuration—paired with a 77 kWh (usable) lithium-ion battery providing approximately 250 miles (WLTP) of range. DC fast charging at up to 170 kW enables a 10-80% charge in approximately 30 minutes under ideal conditions. The interior combines minimalist modern design with practical features and flexible seating arrangements, featuring a standard 10-inch (or optional 12-inch) infotainment touchscreen, touch-sensitive controls, and sustainable materials including recycled plastics and animal-free upholstery options. The passenger version offers five or seven-seat configurations with individual or bench seating in the second row, while the Cargo variant provides up to 137.7 cubic feet of load space. Advanced driver assistance systems include Travel Assist for partially automated driving, Park Assist Plus with memory function, and Car2X communication technology. Future variants are expected to include all-wheel drive models with dual motors, different battery capacities, and specialized versions like the already-announced ID. Buzz California camper van. The ID. Buzz plays a crucial role in Volkswagen's electrification strategy by connecting the brand's heritage to its electric future, appealing to both nostalgic fans of the original VW Bus and contemporary buyers seeking a distinctive, practical electric vehicle with character and versatility beyond conventional SUVs or crossovers."
